Pre-built docker images not work on the raspberry pi
  - Tried open SBB image and MS ML image

Tried to make raspberry pi install with conda

Conda install : Use this shell wget http://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-armv7l.sh

tensorflow should be installed through pip, not conda(Don't know why it is not working)

python3 -m pip install tensorflow not work due to h5py error

So sudo apt-get install libhdf5-dev then sudo pip install tensorflow==1.14.0

pyspark would be just downloaded from apache repository

conda install pip

then used pip to install tensorflow( would it work?)
