The main purpose of this blog is force me to keep engaging on new things outside of my current job. 

Another purpose is to keep communicating with others in a written form so that I can improve my writings.

Although this is my self-exercise for my own good, it would be nice if any of these posts could help you.

I'll start from few paper reviews related to my interest. Here're few algorithms I'm interested in writing some review on:

1. GMM-HMM
2. DNN-HMM
3. seq-to-seq

For these algorithms, I'm planning to go over the theoretical details and potential application ideas that I might dive 
again when I have a chance.

Also, I'm planning to implement the toy example from the scratch so that I can better understand the whole picture.
